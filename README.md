# Wildfire Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing wildfire data. The dashboard is built using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications.

## Files in the Repository

- `Dash_wildfire.py`: The main Python script for generating the dashboard.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `data/`: Directory containing the wildfire data file (e.g., `wildfire_data.csv`).
- `assets/`: Directory for static assets like CSS files (optional).

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you'll need the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Dash Core Components
- Dash HTML Components
- Pandas
- Plotly

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/naurang/australia-wildfire-dasboard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd wildfire-analysis-dashboard
    ```

3. Ensure the data file is in the `data/` directory. For example, if your data file is named `wildfire_data.csv`, it should be placed in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python Dash_wildfire.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050` to view the dashboard.

## Project Structure

The script is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection**: Loading the wildfire data from a specified source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing various analyses to extract insights from the data.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to represent the data and insights.
5. **Dashboard**: Setting up an interactive dashboard to display the visualizations.

## Results

The results of the analysis include various insights into wildfire trends, such as the frequency, duration, and geographical distribution of wildfires. Visualizations are provided to help interpret the findings.
